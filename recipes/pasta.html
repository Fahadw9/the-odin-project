        <strong>Step 1: </strong>Chop all the vegetables and boil the macaroni
        To prepare this delicious dish, take a clean chopping board and chop all the vegetables after washing them. Keep aside the chopped vegetables for later usage. Now, add macaroni to a pot along with water. Add 1/2 tsp salt and give a mix. Now let the macaroni cook on a medium flame until soft.

        <strong>Step 2: </strong>Tenderize the chopped veggies
        Next, take a wok and put it over medium flame. Heat butter in it. Once the butter melts, add onions, corn and bell peppers to it and saute the vegetables in order to tenderize them. Keep stirring them to keep them crunchy. Don't cover with a lid, otherwise the vegetables will limp.
